    "Estimated departure date: Thursday, March 2, 2023\n    Number of travelers: 2\n    Name: David Thompson\n    Inquiry:\n    Hello, my partner and I are planning a trip to Iceland at the beginning of March. We're excited to explore the natural beauty of the country and immerse ourselves in its unique culture.\n\n    We have a limited amount of time, only two days, so we're looking for day tours that offer a snapshot of the best that Iceland has to offer. We're not too particular about specific attractions but would love to see stunning landscapes, waterfalls, and maybe even catch a glimpse of the Northern Lights if possible.\n\n    While we're generally fit and active, we prefer tours with a moderate level of physical activity, as we don't want to exhaust ourselves in such a short timeframe. We're open to suggestions and are flexible with our itinerary.\n\n    As for our departure point, we'll be staying in Reykjavik, so tours that depart from there would be ideal.\n\n    We appreciate any recommendations you can provide to make our short but memorable trip to Iceland enjoyable.\n\n    Thank you for your assistance!",

    "Ni hao! I'm Sarah from China, and I'm planning a trip to Iceland in May with my family. We're a group of four, including two adults and two children aged 13 and 8. We're captivated by the natural beauty of Iceland and are particularly keen on exploring scenic landscapes, waterfalls, and volcanic formations. We also want to learn about Icelandic culture and traditions. Our kids love animals, especially horses and birds, so spotting Icelandic horses and puffins would be fantastic. We're up for some adventure too, like horseback riding or ATV tours. It's important for us to have authentic experiences and try local food. We'll be based in Reykjavik and prefer tours that depart from there. Please suggest a customized itinerary that fulfills our desires. Xie xie!",

    "lucas": "Guten Tag! My name is Lucas, and I'm from Germany. I'm planning a trip to Iceland in August with a group of friends. We're all adults, and there are six of us in total. We're mesmerized by the scenic beauty of Iceland and are particularly interested in exploring picturesque landscapes, waterfalls, and geothermal areas. We also want to immerse ourselves in Icelandic culture and history, so visits to traditional villages, museums, and historical sites would be great. Spotting whales, seals, and arctic foxes is high on our wishlist. We're an adventurous bunch and would love to try glacier hiking, ziplining, or even a helicopter tour for an adrenaline rush. Authentic experiences that allow us to meet locals, enjoy Icelandic music, and savor local cuisine are important to us. We'll be based in Akureyri but have no preference for pick-up. Can you recommend an exciting itinerary that aligns with our desires? Vielen Dank!"
