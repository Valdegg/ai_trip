See for yourself why Silfra is one of the world's most unique freshwater sites! Diving doesn't get much better than this!    4.9          7 reviews         Highlights     Small Group Experience    \u00deingvellir National Park (Thingvellir)    Silfra Fissure    Diving Between Continents    Tectonic Rift Valley    Scuba Diving         We take you where few diving tours in the world can \u2013 into the continental rift between the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates! Thingvellir National Park is home to Silfra fissure, an out-of-this-world subaquatic rift.  Silfra fissure in Iceland has become widely known in the last few years. Divers agree that this is one of the best freshwater dive sites in the world. Glacier water from Langj\u00f6kull glacier that has been filtered through the lava field on its 50 years-long journeys to the fissure is so clear that the visibility is about 100 meters. Silfra is divided into four main sections that we will explore during the tour.  The water in Silfra is at a constant 2-4 degrees celsius throughout the year but all seasons have their charm under the surface. Silfra is situated in the heart of \u00deingvellir National Park, the founding place of the world\u2019s oldest parliament and a UNESCO world heritage site. Silfra is an otherworldly scene located in the lava field directly on top of the continental rift valley between America and Europe.  Usually one does not want to be between a rock and a hard place but in the case of Silfra, you want nothing more. Experience the weightless floating through the clear glacier water going in between the tectonic plates. The slow current gives one a perfect pace to explore this beautiful area. The freshwater visibility is an unmatched specimen, so wide and long that sometimes it is only limited by the density of the water itself.  Depth varies from 10 to 40 meters. Our dive depth is limited to 18 meters by park regulations. This is without question one of the best dive tours the world has to offer. If you are a keen diver, make sure not to miss it! \u00a0Be aware that this is a challenging dive where you need to be capable of carrying heavy equipment up to 400m.  Please read\u00a0our \u00a0 Diving Handbook  for more information about the tour.

It felt like flying around another planet. Nebo, our dive master, was really great as well. He helped kit us up anreven put our fins on for us and the hot chocolate he brought us at the end of the dive was also very welcome. He also took some fantastic photos of us both which we were really pleased with. Can't fault the experience - really professional and thoroughly enjoyable.

During this tour, you will experience a glacier hike on Europe\u2019s biggest glacier and visit a natural ice cave. Sounds exciting, right?    4.6          39 reviews         Highlights     Vatnajokull - Europe's Largest Glacier    Guided Glacier Hike    A Visit to a Natural Ice Cave         This ice caving and glacier hiking adventure tour take place on Europe's largest glacier, Vatnaj\u00f6kull. Ice caves are formed naturally and are, for that reason, forever changing, making them even more charming and unique.  The cave you'll visit is located quite high up on the glacier, so we'll need to hike up to reach it. But don't be afraid! This glacier hike can only add more value to this visit, providing you with two glacier activities instead of one. Visiting a glacier and its ice cave on the volcanic island of Iceland is an awe-inspiring adventure indeed!  \u00a0                                   Availability  Oct - April         Duration  ~4 hours         Departs From  Skaftafell         Level  Moderate         Minimum age  8 years         Ratio  1:12   Guide to client ratio        Meet on Location  Yes         Pick Up  No               From   151     USD       ISK  USD  EUR  CAD       Per  Adult             Best Seller      Expert Guides      Small Group Experience       Best Price Guarantee      Fast & Secure Payment      No Booking Fees       Free Cancellation",

Its waters are volcanically heated by lava flows deep beneath the earth and sit at around 38-40 degrees \u2013 the perfect temperature for bathing. It is also surrounded by truly stunning natural scenery, including rolling green fields, bubbling mud pools and a teeming geyser that spews boiling water into the air every 5 minutes or so.  The facilities around the Secret Lagoon are modern with brand new shower facilities for both men and women and a bar selling traditional Icelandic food and drink, where visitors can purchase a refreshing drink that can be drunk in the warm waters of the lagoon itself. Relaxing in one of the world\u2019s finest natural spas is an amazing experience and we hope you can join us there!

Then the same way back. It was without stress or rush, just very relaxed and fun. You never had the feeling that you are only a number to be rushed through.
